# NPaint
### A graphic editor (like MS Paint) that allows you to create a certain set of 2D figures, as well as any polygons, and then edit them: moving, scaling and changing attributes. Uses the mouse and context menu. It also allows you to save the created image in the form of serialization and move sets of figures.
### The project implements 8 design patterns.
